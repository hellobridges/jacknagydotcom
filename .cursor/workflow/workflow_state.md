## Rules
> **Keep every major section under an explicit H2 (`##`) heading so the agent can locate them unambiguously.**

### [PHASE: ANALYZE]
1. Read **project_config.md**, relevant code & docs.  
2. Summarize requirements. *No code or planning.*

### [PHASE: BLUEPRINT]
1. Decompose task into ordered steps.  
2. Write pseudocode or file-level diff outline under **## Plan**.  
3. Set `Status = NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL` and await user confirmation.

### [PHASE: CONSTRUCT]
1. Follow the approved **## Plan** exactly.  
2. After each atomic change:  
   - run test / linter commands specified in `project_config.md`  
   - capture tool output in **## Log**  
3. On success of all steps, set `Phase = VALIDATE`.

### [PHASE: VALIDATE]
1. Rerun full test suite & any E2E checks.  
2. If clean, set `Status = COMPLETED`.  
3. Trigger **RULE_ITERATE_01** when applicable.
4. Trigger **RULE_GIT_COMMIT_01** to prompt for version control.

---

### RULE_INIT_01
Trigger ▶ `Phase == INIT`  
Action ▶ Ask user for first high-level task → `Phase = ANALYZE, Status = RUNNING`.

### RULE_ITERATE_01
Trigger ▶ `Status == COMPLETED && Items contains unprocessed rows`  
Action ▶  
1. Set `CurrentItem` to next unprocessed row in **## Items**.  
2. Clear **## Log**, reset `Phase = ANALYZE, Status = READY`.

### RULE_LOG_ROTATE_01
Trigger ▶ `length(## Log) > 5 000 chars`  
Action ▶ Summarise the top 5 findings from **## Log** into **## ArchiveLog**, then clear **## Log**.

### RULE_SUMMARY_01
Trigger ▶ `Phase == VALIDATE && Status == COMPLETED`  
Action ▶ 
1. Read `project_config.md`.
2. Construct the new changelog line: `- <One-sentence summary of completed work>`.
3. Find the `## Changelog` heading in `project_config.md`.
4. Insert the new changelog line immediately after the `## Changelog` heading and its following newline (making it the new first item in the list).

---

### Git Workflow
> Rules for interacting with the Git version control system.

#### RULE_GIT_COMMIT_01
Trigger ▶ `Phase == VALIDATE && Status == COMPLETED`  
Action ▶ 
1. Prompt user to commit changes with a generated message (e.g., `Phase X: [brief description]`).
2. Suggest creating a new branch for significant changes (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/new-thing`).
3. Upon user confirmation, execute the `git add .` and `git commit` commands.
4. Retrieve the new commit SHA using `git rev-parse HEAD`.
5. Prepend the SHA and commit message to `## Workflow History`.

#### RULE_GIT_ROLLBACK_01
Trigger ▶ User command like "revert to..." or "rollback to..." followed by a description.
Action ▶ 
1. Search `## Workflow History` for the SHA corresponding to the description.
2. If found, execute `git checkout <SHA>`.
3. If not found, inform the user.

#### RULE_GIT_DIFF_01
Trigger ▶ User command like "diff..." or "compare..." with two descriptions.
Action ▶ 
1. Find the two SHAs from `## Workflow History` based on the descriptions.
2. If found, execute `git diff <SHA1> <SHA2>`.
3. If not found, inform the user.

#### RULE_GIT_GUIDANCE_01
Trigger ▶ User asks for help with Git (e.g., "how do I use git?").
Action ▶ Provide a brief list of common Git commands (`commit`, `branch`, `checkout`, `diff`).
